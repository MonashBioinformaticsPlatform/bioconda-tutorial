This tutorial covers the basics of setting up the `conda` tool to install bioinformatics tools from [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) and producing "reproducible environments" as a foundation for your own analysis or pipeline. You don't need `sudo`.

* View the [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/MonashBioinformaticsPlatform/bioconda-tutorial/blob/master/Bioconda_Installation.ipynb).
* Or as [slides](https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/bioconda-tutorial/#/)

# Requirements:

Just reading the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/MonashBioinformaticsPlatform/bioconda-tutorial/blob/master/Bioconda_Installation.ipynb) right here on Github and cut'n'pasting into your terminal is probably all you need.

However, if you'd like to run this notebook on your computer, you will need:

* Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)
* Jupyter Bash Kernel: https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel

If you've cloned the repository, to view the slides locally.
```bash
run_slides.h
```
